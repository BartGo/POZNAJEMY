Additional materials for the book "Poznajemy Forth" ("We study Forth"), written in Polish in the 1987 by Jan Ruszczyc. The code is based mostly on Atari 8-bit implementation of fig-Forth, called "APX Extended fig-Forth". These materials contain:
- a floppy image (ATR), readable by an emulator (e.g. Altirra), containing sources from the book (Polish word/variable names, consistent with the book) and additional tools (all in English) - published in Forth Dimension or other magazines from the 1980s/1990s; screens 16-17 contain a list of all included sources, with their origin, dependencies, starting screen and number of screens
- a script (which can be pasted into Altirra according to the included description) which builds above mentioned ATR file, commented mostly in English (with exceptions in Polish, when related to the book)
- a leaflet, added to the physical edition of the floppy, explaining how to run, use and copy it - in Polish, soon to be translated into English 

The book has been released by:
SOETO 1987, RETRONICS 2024.

All the included materials were assembled (often also typed in), embedded into a script, tested, corrected and commented by me.  My thanks go to RETRONICS for allowing me to expose code from their book here.

The APX Forth itself is not included (it can be obtained legally though). All the software code had been either originally published with the intention of being used for education and wide usage -- or is explicitly public domain (e.g. Fig editor, the assembler). Code from the book itself is rarely super-original as is was usually adapted from other Forth materials (books, magazines).
